## Text-Utils 

A Text-Utility app made with react where we can write some text and perform the following functions on it: 
-  To convert text to Upper case
-  To convert text to Lower case
-  To remove extra spaces
-  To clear text 
-  To copy text 

and we can get a text summary of our text which tells us about the number of characters and words our text has.
It also has a dark mode feature.
