# Reacting-to-react âš›
A collection of my react projects which I made while learning React.ðŸ˜Š
## 1)  Text-Utils
A Text-Utility app made with react where we can write some text and perform the following functions on it: 
#### 1) To convert text to Upper case
#### 2) To convert text to Lower case
#### 3) To remove extra spaces
#### 4) To clear text 
#### 5) To copy text 
and we can get a text summary of our text which tells us about the number of characters and words our text has.
It also has a dark mode feature.
